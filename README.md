# Profit Trailer Settings

Profit Trailer used to have a collection of different settings to choose from but they were removed because they were out of date.

Here are some of the old settings that used to be included.  [Here](https://github.com/PTdude/Profit-Trailer-Settings/releases/tag/1) is a zip file with all of them.

## **WARNING**<br>
Not all of these settings will work anymore because PT has changed a lot.  Some of the code in these settings may be broken or deprecated.<br><br>
**DO NOT just copy and paste these and expect them to work!**  
Use them as examples to study and modify and learn what PT can do.
