# PT-Settings

PT used to have a collection of different settings to choose from but they were removed.

For some reason the team thinks their mission is to force users to learn technical analysis before using their bot, instead of making an easy to use product that appeals to new traders.

Here are some of the old settings to choose from that used to be included.

**WARNING**<br>
Not all of these settings will work anymore because PT has changed a lot.  Some of the code is outdated and deprecated.<br>
**DO NOT just copy and paste these and expect them to work!**  Use them as examples to study and modify and learn what PT can do.
